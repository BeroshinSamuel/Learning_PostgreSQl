Question - A company wants to store customer information in a PostgreSQL database. The customers table has the following columns:

customer_id (integer, primary key, auto-increment)
customer_name (varchar, not null)
email (varchar, unique)
phone (varchar, unique)
created_at (timestamp, default current timestamp)

Write an SQL INSERT statement to add a new customer named "John Doe" with the email "johndoe@email.com" and phone "123-456-7890" into the customers table.

Solution:
INSERT INTO customers (customer_name, email, phone)  
VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@email.com', '123-456-7890');

Explanation:
We insert values into the customers table.
The customer_id is auto-incremented, so we donâ€™t need to specify it.
The created_at column (if set to DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) will automatically store the insertion time.
