* Creating the Table with Auto-Increment customer_id

CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY);

✅ SERIAL automatically generates unique customer_id values starting from 1.
✅ PRIMARY KEY ensures that each customer_id is unique.


* If You Want to Start From a Specific Number?

ALTER SEQUENCE customers_customer_id_seq RESTART WITH 100;

✅ This makes customer_id start at 100 instead of 1.
