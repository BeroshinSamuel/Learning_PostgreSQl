Instead of deleting a customer permanently, add a deleted flag.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Add a deleted Column

ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

Example:   

alter table customers add column deleted boolean default false;
ALTER TABLE

select * from customers order by customer_id asc;

 customer_id |   customer_name    |             email              |    phone     |   address   | deleted
-------------+--------------------+--------------------------------+--------------+-------------+---------
           2 | Bob Smith          |                                | 987-654-3210 | 202 Oak Ave | f
           3 | Sam                | Sam@company.com                | 897777       | Chennai     | f
           4 | user name          | user name@company.com          | 9892734827   | chennai     | f
           5 | test user          | test user@company.com          | 283748923    | chennai     | f
           7 | sales agent        | sales agent@company.com        | 43765873     | america     | f
           8 | admin manager      | admin manager@company.com      | 72349872     | canada      | f
           9 | genreal manager    | genreal manager@company.com    | 48598237     | srilanka    | f
          10 | department manager | department manager@company.com | 4985982      | africa      | f
          11 | ceo                | ceo@company.com                | 8374837      | india       | f
(9 rows)

Step 2: "Soft Delete" Instead of Hard Delete

UPDATE customers SET deleted = TRUE WHERE customer_id = 5;
✅ The customer isn't really deleted, just marked as deleted.

Example:

inventory_db=# update customers
inventory_db-# set deleted = true where customer_id = 5;
UPDATE 1

inventory_db=# select * from customers order by customer_id asc;

 customer_id |   customer_name    |             email              |    phone     |   address   | deleted
-------------+--------------------+--------------------------------+--------------+-------------+---------
           2 | Bob Smith          |                                | 987-654-3210 | 202 Oak Ave | f
           3 | Sam                | Sam@company.com                | 897777       | Chennai     | f
           4 | user name          | user name@company.com          | 9892734827   | chennai     | f
           5 | test user          | test user@company.com          | 283748923    | chennai     | t
           7 | sales agent        | sales agent@company.com        | 43765873     | america     | f
           8 | admin manager      | admin manager@company.com      | 72349872     | canada      | f
           9 | genreal manager    | genreal manager@company.com    | 48598237     | srilanka    | f
          10 | department manager | department manager@company.com | 4985982      | africa      | f
          11 | ceo                | ceo@company.com                | 8374837      | india       | f
(9 rows)

Step 3: Retrieve Only Active Customers

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE deleted = FALSE;
✅ This keeps deleted customers in the database, so you can restore them later.

Example:

Active Customers

inventory_db=# select * from customers where deleted = false order by customer_id asc;

 customer_id |   customer_name    |             email              |    phone     |   address   | deleted
-------------+--------------------+--------------------------------+--------------+-------------+---------
           2 | Bob Smith          |                                | 987-654-3210 | 202 Oak Ave | f
           3 | Sam                | Sam@company.com                | 897777       | Chennai     | f
           4 | user name          | user name@company.com          | 9892734827   | chennai     | f
           7 | sales agent        | sales agent@company.com        | 43765873     | america     | f
           8 | admin manager      | admin manager@company.com      | 72349872     | canada      | f
           9 | genreal manager    | genreal manager@company.com    | 48598237     | srilanka    | f
          10 | department manager | department manager@company.com | 4985982      | africa      | f

(8 rows)

Non Actve Customers

inventory_db=# select * from customers where deleted = true order by customer_id;

 customer_id | customer_name |         email         |   phone   | address | deleted
-------------+---------------+-----------------------+-----------+---------+---------
           5 | test user     | test user@company.com | 283748923 | chennai | t
